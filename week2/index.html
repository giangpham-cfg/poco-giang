              <h3>Fun facts</h3>
              <p>
                <strong>Coffee Culture:</strong> Vietnam is the world's
                second-largest exporter of coffee, famous for its strong and
                delicious Vietnamese coffee, often served with condensed milk.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Motorbike Madness:</strong> Motorbikes are the primary
                mode of transportation in Vietnam's bustling cities. The streets
                can seem chaotic with thousands of motorbikes weaving through
                traffic, creating a unique energy.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Rice Fields:</strong> Vietnam is one of the world's
                largest exporters of rice. The country's terraced rice fields,
                especially in the northern mountainous regions, are not only
                beautiful but also demonstrate incredible agricultural
                ingenuity.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>War History:</strong> Vietnam has a complex history,
                including its involvement in the Vietnam War (known locally as
                the American War). Sites like the Cu Chi Tunnels near Ho Chi
                Minh City offer a glimpse into the country's wartime past.
